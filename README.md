# Converting-simple-images-to-Intuitionistic-fuzzy-image
Converting Gray Scale image to intuitionistic fuzzy  Images and convert this Fuzzy Image to RGB using intuitionistic Fuzzy Entropy.
first we can upload our simple gray image in google colab and then we give path to our image data set after that we can preprocess our gray image data set. 
then we use Fuzzy logic libaries which help us to finding the values of membership, non-membership and degree of hesitancy from simple image and then we convert this simple image to intuitionistic fuzzy images using these membership, non-membership and degree of hesitancy.
membership shows that how much a pixel belong to the image. non-membership shows not belongingness and degree of hesitancy means uncertainity.
after converting the image to intuitionistic fuzzy images we can find the Intuitionistic fuzzy entropy of the image and convert this image to RGB color Image.
